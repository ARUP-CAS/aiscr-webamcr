Dokumentace kodu
==================

Here we can find the code documentation ordered by the project apps structure. Each app is defined to manage a specific functionality in the project. 

"What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects." [ref]_.
